### Linear Algebra

## Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics, but the truth of it is that linear algebra is the
mathematics of data. Matrices and vectors are the language of data. Linear algebra is about
linear combinations. That is, using arithmetic on columns of numbers called vectors and arrays
of numbers called matrices, to create new columns and arrays of numbers.
Linear algebra is the study of lines and planes, vector spaces and mappings that are required for linear transforms.
